### **Objective**

The aim of this section is to perform dynamic analysis using DAST tools on DVNA and solve the 6th point of the [Problem Statement](problem_statements.md) under Task 1.

About DAST

- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is a testing methodology which looks for security vulnerabilities by simulating external attacks on an application while the application is running. 
- DAST performs black-box security testing.

### **OWASP ZAP**

The Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is one of the most widely-used open source tools for DAST. It helps find security vulnerabilities in web applications while its in the development and testing stage.  Maintained by OWASP, ZAP has built a huge community of people creating new features and add-ons that make it incredibly versatile. 

Implementing ZAP analysis with docker is simpler and faster than manual installation. I followed this [official documentation](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/docker/about/). First, pull the ZAP image from docker hub.

```bash
sudo docker pull owasp/zap2docker-stable
```

We will be running a baseline scan as it is ideal in a CI/CD environment, even against production sites.

Docker flags used  
--rm, remove container after completion  
-d, run as a background job  
-u <user>, specify user to run container as  
-v 'host dir':'container dir', mount volumes  

Zap CLI flags used  
-t 'target', specify target to scan  
-r 'file.html', generate an HTML output report  
-l level, minimum level to show: PASS, IGNORE, INFO, WARN or FAIL.

```bash
sudo docker run --rm -d -u zap --name owasp-zap -v ~/:/zap/wrk/ owasp/zap2docker-stable zap-baseline.py -t http://192.168.56.102:9090 -r zap-report.html -l PASS
```

To run a fullscan script, run the following command
```bash
sudo docker run --rm -d -u zap --name owasp-zap -v ~/:/zap/wrk/ owasp/zap2docker-stable zap-full-scan.py -t http://192.168.56.102:9090 -r zap-report.html -l PASS
```

The report `zap-report.html`, generated on successful completion, will be located in the users home directory.

**Note:** To open .html file in browser from terminal, type `open zap-report.html` from host terminal.

### **DAST Pipeline**

Add the following stage in the Jenkins pipelien for performing DAST on DVNA.

```bash    
stage('ZAP Scan') {
  steps {
    sh 'docker run --rm -i -u zap --name owasp-zap -v ~/reports/:/zap/wrk/ owasp/zap2docker-stable zap-baseline.py -t http://192.168.56.102:9090 -r zap-report.html -l PASS || true'
  }
}
```

**Note:** As we've already seen in [Setup of Production Server](production_setup.md), DVNA is deployed in a docker container. To perform DAST on DVNA, the application will run in a docker container and the DAST tool will run in another container (as shown earlier in this section). To work with docker containers via Jenkins pipeline, you'll need to add `jenkins` user to group `docker` to run docker commands without sudo.

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins
sudo reboot
```

The complete report generated by OWASP ZAP can be found [here](https://github.com/tariqahmed1912/internship-kloudle/blob/main/reports/zap-report.html).

### **Increase VM Disk Space (Optional)**
While trying to run the Jenkins pipeline, I noticed there was an error during the ZAP scan. On reviewing the container logs, I realized that my VM was out of disk space. So instead of creating a new VM with more disk space (I was currently using the default 10GB), I decided to increase the disk space of the Jenkins VM to 16GB.

I followed this [documentation](https://ourcodeworld.com/articles/read/1434/how-to-increase-the-disk-size-of-a-dynamically-allocated-disk-in-virtualbox). Get location of your Jenkins VM virtual hard disk. Go to `Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager` -> `Jenkins Server` -> `Settings` -> `Storage` -> `Controller: IDE`.

**Increase Disk Size**

To increase size of virtual disk, type the following command in the terminal (for Linux/MaxOS).

```bash
VBoxManage  modifyhd --resize <NEW-SIZE> <LOCATION-OF-VDI-IMAGE>
```

Check if size changed successfully.

```bash
VBoxManage showhdinfo <LOCATION-OF-VDI-IMAGE> | grep Capacity
```

**Boot from GParted on your VM**

I followed the same steps as mentioned in the `Boot from GParted on your VM` section of the [documentation](https://ourcodeworld.com/articles/read/1434/how-to-increase-the-disk-size-of-a-dynamically-allocated-disk-in-virtualbox). Even after having followed all the steps, the partition was still not set properly. I found the solution to this problem [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1106795/ubuntu-server-18-04-lvm-out-of-space-with-improper-default-partitioning).

In the Jenkins VM, resize the logical volume to use all the existing and free space of the volume group.

```bash
sudo lvm

lvm> lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv
lvm> exit
```

After the command above is successful, resize the file system to use the new available space in the logical volume.

```bash
sudo resize2fs /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv
```

Check if the available space has increased.
```bash
df -h
```

**Note:** While running the ZAP scan in pipeline, I got the following error: ```ERROR [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/zap/wrk/zap-report.html'```.  To resolve this error, I changed the permissions of `/var/lib/jenkins/reports` directory.

```bash
sudo chmod 777 /var/lib/jenkins/report
```
